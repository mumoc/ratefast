You'll need your **Github Key** and **Github Secret** from a [new app][].

Go and copy the **.env.example** as **.env** with:

`cp .env.example .env`

And update the values with your keys (the ones in the example are dummy)

Then, go ahead and run

`bundle exec rake db:create; bundle exec rake db:migrate; bundle exec rake db:seed`
